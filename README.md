"Move!" is a web app that allows the user to input their desired type of workout and gives them a specialized workout catered to their needs. "Move!" is an individually developed program built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I created this web app for the 2018 Congressional App Challenge and was selected as a national winner.
